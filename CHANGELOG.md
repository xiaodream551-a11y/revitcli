# Changelog

All notable changes to RevitCli will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — RVT backup cleanup

- Added `revitcli rvt scan` and `revitcli rvt clean-backups` to find local
  `.rvt` files, classify numbered backups such as `model.0001.rvt`, preview
  cleanup candidates with JSON/Markdown reports, and delete only after
  explicit `--apply --yes` confirmation.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added — v2.4 safe batch plans

- `plan-receipt.v1` now records explicit rollback actions for set/import plan
  applies, and `revitcli rollback <artifact>` can restore from either a fix
  baseline or a saved plan receipt with current-value conflict checks.
- Safe-plan examples and Codex recipe docs now show the full review/apply/
  receipt rollback path, including high-impact confirmation for large
  parameter updates.

### Added — v2.5 delivery workflows

- v2.5 delivery workflows are marked complete in the roadmap. Workflow
  validation now rejects unknown `revitcli` commands and grouped subcommands,
  keeping workflow YAML limited to visible CLI command surfaces.

### Added — v3.0 project standards workbench

- `standards install` now copies every relative profile declared in
  `required.profiles`, allowing office standards packs to bootstrap multiple
  governed profile files before terminal validation.
- Standards bootstrap docs now show the full dry-run, install, local standards,
  workflow, and family-rule check path for new projects.

### Added — v3.x review and knowledge capture

- `revitcli report knowledge` summarizes local history, journal command
  repetition, workflow receipts, delivery manifests/receipts, standards
  validation, and saved weekly reports into table, JSON, or Markdown review
  notes. It only emits reuse hints and does not write workflows, standards, or
  any LLM/MCP runtime state.
- Knowledge reports now include review-only workflow YAML drafts from repeated
  journal command sequences, making the v3.x local knowledge-capture path
  complete without adding hidden writes or runtime dependencies.

### Added — v4.0 architect terminal BIM workbench

- `revitcli workbench contract` prints a read-only `workbench-contract.v1`
  command contract as table, compact JSON, or Markdown so Codex CLI can
  discover stable command vocabulary, dry-run expectations, receipt locations,
  and exit-code notes without depending on dashboard, cloud, LLM runtime, or
  MCP extensions.
- `workbench-contract.v1` now includes callable `commandPaths` such as
  `plan apply`, `workflow review`, `workbench verify`, `workbench receipts`,
  `workbench paths`, `workbench exits`, `workbench project`,
  `workbench handoff`, and `deliverables bundle`;
  `workbench verify` checks that required callable paths remain present.
- `revitcli workbench receipts` prints a read-only `workbench-receipts.v1`
  index of receipt schemas, write triggers, path patterns, dry-run commands,
  and review commands for export, publish, plan apply, workflow run, and
  delivery bundle evidence.
- `revitcli workbench paths` prints a read-only `workbench-paths.v1` flat
  callable path index with risk, output support, dry-run/receipt expectations,
  and exit-code notes.
- `revitcli workbench exits` prints a read-only `workbench-exit-codes.v1`
  index so shell scripts and Codex CLI can review success/failure semantics
  without scraping help text.
- `revitcli workbench extensions` prints a read-only
  `workbench-extensions.v1` index of terminal-first extension points, file
  patterns, validation commands, preview commands, and write behavior for
  profiles, workflow YAML, standards packs, family rules, and recipe docs.
- `revitcli workbench outputs` prints a read-only `workbench-outputs.v1`
  index of readable table support, compact JSON schema names, and Markdown
  support for key Codex-callable terminal paths.
- `revitcli workbench safeguards` prints a read-only
  `workbench-safeguards.v1` index of dry-run, approval, receipt, and review
  commands for risky export/write/local-write/mixed terminal paths.
- `revitcli workbench project --dir <path>` prints a read-only
  `workbench-project.v1` inventory of local project artifacts such as
  profiles, standards, workflows, workflow receipts, history, journal,
  delivery manifests, delivery receipts, plans, and reports, including counts
  and review commands without requiring Revit, dashboard, cloud, MCP, or an LLM
  runtime.
- `revitcli workbench handoff --dir <path>` prints a read-only
  `workbench-handoff.v1` summary of contract verification status, project
  readiness check summaries, artifact counts, machine-readable readiness
  actions for actionable missing or empty local artifacts, recommended next
  terminal commands, and non-goal reminders for a single Codex CLI project handoff
  command; it now includes saved-plan discovery plus the
  `schedule create --dry-run --output json` preview path.
- `revitcli schedule create --dry-run --output json|markdown` now prints a
  `schedule-create.v1` preview without calling Revit, validates unsupported
  filters and sort-field requirements before writes, and successful real
  creates write `schedule-create-receipt.v1` receipts under
  `.revitcli/receipts` by default.
- `schedule create --output json|markdown` now returns `schedule-create.v1`
  failure envelopes for create validation and server errors, making the write
  path machine-readable on both success and failure.
- `schedule-create.v1` success output now includes `receiptRequired` and
  `receiptSaved` so a real write with missing local evidence is visible to
  scripts even when the Revit operation itself succeeded.
- `workbench verify` now guards the callable path index against write commands
  without dry-run/receipt contracts; `schedule create` is now exposed because
  it has both.
- `workbench verify` now also guards the v4 terminal contract against LLM
  runtime, prompt/chat/agent, dashboard dependency, SaaS/cloud sync, and ACC
  command paths.
- `workbench verify` now checks the legacy MCP compatibility command remains
  hidden, deprecated, and excluded from public command discovery.
- `workbench verify` now checks that the extension-point surface covers
  profiles, workflow YAML, standards packs, and family rules through terminal
  validation and preview commands.
- `workbench verify` now checks that key output schemas such as
  `workbench-contract.v1`, `workbench-project.v1`, `workbench-handoff.v1`,
  `schedule-create.v1`, `workflow-review.v1`, `workflow-receipts.v1`,
  `example-recipes.v1`, and `model-health-history.v1` remain indexed.
- `workbench verify` now checks the project inventory surface for expected
  local artifacts and review commands.
- `workbench verify` now checks the handoff readiness-action surface so
  actionable missing or empty project artifacts keep bootstrap/review commands
  in the `workbench-handoff.v1` contract.
- `workbench verify` now checks the handoff recommended command surface so
  workflow discovery, saved-plan discovery, and schedule-create dry-run stay in
  the `workbench-handoff.v1` next-command list.
- `workbench verify` now includes a `schedule-create-safety` check so the
  newly callable schedule-write path must keep dry-run, receipt, output, and
  safeguard coverage together.
- `workbench verify` now checks that core risky paths keep dry-run/approval
  safeguards indexed for export, publish, plan apply, rollback, workflow run,
  and delivery bundle.
- `revitcli examples <topic> --output json|markdown` exposes the existing
  architect workflow examples as an `example-recipes.v1` envelope and
  handoff-ready Markdown, giving Codex CLI a deterministic prompt-to-command
  recipe surface without adding a prompt interpreter.
- `revitcli workbench verify` prints a read-only `workbench-verification.v1`
  readiness report for root-command alignment, MCP public exclusion, recipe
  output support, risky-command dry-run/receipt coverage, and exit-code notes.
- `workbench verify --dir <path>` now evaluates project-inventory readiness
  for a selected project directory, and `workbench handoff --dir <path>` carries
  that directory into its follow-up verify/project/workflow discovery commands.
- `revitcli inspect workflows --output json|markdown` adds a read-only
  `inspect-workflows.v1` local workflow YAML inventory with
  validate/simulate/review/dry-run/approved-run/receipt next commands.
- Workflow validation now recognizes `report knowledge`, `inspect workflows`,
  `inspect plans`, `workflow review`, and read-only `workbench` handoff
  commands as existing RevitCli command paths, and rejects unknown `workbench`
  subcommands before execution.
- `workflow validate`, `workflow simulate`, and `workflow run` now reject
  unknown `--output` values before reading or executing workflow steps, keeping
  v4 workflow reports predictable for scripts and Codex CLI.
- Shell completions now mirror those workflow output contracts: `workflow
  suggest --output` offers table/json/yaml, while validate/simulate/review/run,
  examples, and receipts offer table/json/markdown. Schedule completions now
  keep list/create on table/json/markdown and reserve CSV for `schedule export`.
- `workbench verify` now checks the shell completion contract for
  inspect/workbench/workflow/schedule v4 subcommands, key handoff options, and
  subcommand-specific output formats.
- zsh completions now expose `workbench --dir`, `schedule --dry-run`, and
  `schedule --receipt-dir` so terminal discovery covers local project handoff
  and schedule-create receipt paths.
- `revitcli workflow review <file>` adds a read-only `workflow-review.v1`
  handoff surface with pre-run workbench verify/handoff commands, approval
  counts, inferred project artifact readiness for workflow step dependencies,
  saved-plan review through `inspect plans --dir <path>`, recommended
  validate/simulate/dry-run commands, post-run receipt triage commands,
  acceptance evidence hints, and workflow issues before any run.
- `workflow review --dir <path>` now carries that project directory into its
  pre-run workbench verify/handoff and workflow discovery commands.
- `workflow run --timeout-ms <n>` now bounds each executed workflow step; timed
  out steps return exit code 124, record `timedOut` and `timeoutMs` in
  `workflow-run-receipt.v1`, skip remaining steps unless `--continue-on-error`
  is set, and still write receipt evidence.
- Add-in builds now choose a single target framework from `RevitYear` by
  default (`2024` -> `net48`, `2025/2026` -> `net8.0-windows`) and accept
  per-year `Revit2024InstallDir` / `Revit2025InstallDir` /
  `Revit2026InstallDir` MSBuild overrides.
- `scripts/smoke-revit.ps1` and the legacy `smoke-revit2026.ps1` now expose
  `-V4Workbench` to run the v4 workbench verifier and live read-only
  inspect/schedule discovery against the active Revit document during real
  smoke.
- Real Revit smoke scripts now retry explicitly transient add-in communication
  timeouts only for read-only or dry-run commands, record the attempt number
  and retry-safety flag for each command step, and preserve the failed attempt
  in the report so flake evidence is visible instead of hidden.
- `workflow-run-receipt.v1` now records total run duration plus per-step
  duration metadata for executed steps; `workflow receipts` surfaces duration
  evidence in table, JSON, and Markdown output, and `workbench verify` checks
  the duration and timeout telemetry contract.
- `workflow receipts --min-duration-ms` filters local workflow receipts by
  run duration for long-running automation triage.
- `workflow receipts --sort duration|completed` controls receipt ordering for
  slow-run review while keeping completed-time ordering as the default.
- `workflow receipts --window 24h|7d|60m` filters receipt review to a recent
  local time window for deadline-day automation triage.
- `workbench verify` now checks the workflow receipt triage contract for
  name, minimum-duration, duration-sort, and recent-window review.
- `workbench verify` now checks the inspect workflow discovery surface for
  `inspect-workflows.v1` JSON/Markdown handoff coverage.
- `revitcli inspect plans --dir <path> --output json|markdown` adds a
  read-only `inspect-plans.v1` saved mutation plan inventory with action
  counts, high-impact/invalid status, receipt detection, `plan show`,
  dry-run apply, approved apply, and rollback-preview commands.
- `workbench verify` now checks the inspect plan discovery surface for
  `inspect-plans.v1` JSON/Markdown handoff coverage.
- `workbench verify` now checks the built-in workflow template surface so
  `pre-issue`, `weekly-health`, `export-package`, and `family-cleanup` must
  exist, load, simulate without issues, and keep acceptance examples.
- `workbench verify` now checks the `workflow-review.v1` handoff contract for
  pre-run workbench handoff commands, project artifact readiness, and post-run
  receipt triage commands.
- Ubuntu CI now runs `workbench verify --dir . --output json`, and
  `release verify` checks that this v4 contract gate remains in CI before the
  separate Windows/Revit live smoke gate.
- `revitcli score --history <duration> --output json|markdown` now exposes
  local model-health trend output as `model-health-history.v1`, and the v4
  workbench contract/path index includes `score --history` as a Codex-callable
  terminal health review path.
- `revitcli examples workbench` documents the v4 workbench contract, verifier,
  project inventory, terminal handoff, recipe JSON, and workflow-review path as a single
  copy-paste terminal topic.
- `revitcli examples schedule` now includes a schedule-create dry-run command
  so ViewSchedule writes have a copy-paste preview path.
- Shell completions now include `report knowledge` so the local knowledge
  report is discoverable through the same terminal-first command surface.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-17

### Release

- The GitHub release ZIP packages the CLI and Revit 2026 add-in. Revit 2024
  and 2025 remain source-build compatibility targets when matching Revit API
  DLLs are available.
- The release workflow resolves Revit 2026 API DLLs from
  `REVITCLI_REVIT2026_INSTALL_DIR` when set, otherwise from the default
  `%ProgramFiles%\Autodesk\Revit 2026` install path.
- NuGet publishing is now a manual `Publish to NuGet` workflow so release tags
  do not require a NuGet API key unless the CLI package is being published.

### Added — v2.1 configuration confidence

- `revitcli doctor --check-version 2024|2025|2026` validates the requested
  Revit install path, add-in manifest, server info, and live Revit year
  instead of assuming the 2026 smoke baseline.
- `scripts/smoke-revit.ps1 -Version 2024|2025|2026` parameterizes the
  live smoke chain and records per-version metadata in its JSON report.
- Added the self-hosted GitHub Actions smoke matrix template at
  `docs/ci/smoke-matrix-template.yml` and version compatibility notes at
  `docs/revit-version-compatibility.md`.
- `revitcli journal sign` and `revitcli journal verify` add a SHA256
  hash-chain + local-HMAC integrity layer for `.revitcli/journal.jsonl`.
  The signature is written to `.revitcli/journal.jsonl.sig`; `--until`
  can seal entries through a specific timestamp while allowing later
  appends.

### Changed — v2.2 terminal trust

- `scripts/install.ps1` now accepts per-year source-tree install directory
  overrides: `-Revit2024InstallDir`, `-Revit2025InstallDir`, and
  `-Revit2026InstallDir`. The legacy `-RevitInstallDir` option remains a
  Revit 2026 alias.
- Installer year parsing now accepts both `"2024,2025,2026"` and the native
  PowerShell list form `2024,2025,2026`.
- Installer PATH updates now use exact path-list matching instead of substring
  matching, and Revit add-in manifests are generated through XML APIs.
- Installer now uses layered updates when Revit is running: CLI files update
  immediately, add-ins are staged under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RevitCli\staged`, and
  the Revit manifest points to the staged DLL for the next Revit restart.
  `-AllowRunningRevit` is available only for explicit locked-file risk testing.
- Added `docs/release-checklist.md` for Windows/Revit release gates, dashboard
  checks, live smoke evidence, journal verification, changelog, version bump,
  and tag flow.
- Recorded 2026-04-30 Revit 2026 local smoke evidence in
  `docs/revit-version-compatibility.md`, including layered installer, dry-run,
  set apply/restore, and journal verification results.
- `revitcli mcp serve` is now hidden and deprecated as a compatibility-only
  entry point. It is removed from command discovery surfaces while remaining
  callable for existing local scripts.
- `revitcli examples <topic>` adds local copy-paste command examples for
  architect workflows such as inspect, sheets, schedule export, safe set/import
  plans, publish, doctor/smoke, and journal verification.
- `revitcli release verify` adds a local release preflight for
  `RevitCliVersion`, tag consistency, changelog/README/checklist presence,
  Ubuntu CLI/Shared-only CI guardrails, installer hardening markers, release
  packaging workflow markers, and smoke documentation. Live Revit smoke remains
  a separate Windows/Revit checklist gate. `--output markdown` adds a
  maintainer-facing release handoff view.
- `revitcli deliverables list|stats|verify|bundle --output markdown` adds
  architect-readable delivery handoff summaries for manifest receipt review and
  bundle dry-runs.
- `revitcli workflow receipts` reviews local `workflow-run-receipt.v1` files
  with table, JSON, or Markdown output plus `--failed-only` and `--name`
  triage.
- `revitcli inspect categories|params|schedules|sheets --output markdown`
  adds handoff-ready discovery reports for Codex CLI and architect review.
- `revitcli schedule list|export --output markdown` adds handoff-ready
  schedule tables, and `schedule export` now rejects unknown output formats
  before contacting Revit.

### Added — v2.3 inspect/discover

- Element query responses now include `parameterMetadata` with command-ready
  parameter names, values, storage type, read-only state, and write-candidate
  status while keeping the existing `parameters` dictionary for compatibility.
- `revitcli inspect params <category>` now aggregates writable status, storage
  types, value coverage, and dry-run `set` probes so Codex CLI can choose safer
  parameter write candidates before planning a batch edit.

### Added — v1.6 history (complete)

- `revitcli history` command cluster — local snapshot timeline under
  `.revitcli/history/`, gzip-compressed:
  - `history init` — create the store + empty index.
  - `history capture [--source manual|cron|fix-baseline] [--exclude-fixes]` —
    take a snapshot via the addin and append to the timeline.
  - `history list [--include-fixes] [--limit N]` — table view of recent
    snapshots (id, capturedAt, source, elementCount, size).
  - `history prune --keep <duration|count> [--dry-run] [--apply]` — drop old
    entries; fix-baseline snapshots are protected by default.
  - `history diff <fromRef> <toRef> [--output table|json|markdown]
    [--max-rows N] [--categories LIST]` — diff two snapshots resolved from
    the timeline; reuses the v1.1 `SnapshotDiffer` + `DiffRenderer`.
  - `history trend [--metric <name>] [--window <duration>] [--width N]` —
    ASCII sparkline (`▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█`) + per-point row over a rolling window.
    Default metric `score`, default window `30d`, default width 60. Other
    supported metrics: `elements.<category>`, `sheets`, `schedules`,
    `count.<key>`.
  - Time references parse `@-N` (Nth most recent), ISO 8601 timestamps, and
    durations like `7d` / `24h` / `30m`.
- `revitcli score --history <duration>` — per-day score time series
  (LAST snapshot of each day) with new / resolved / unchanged columns;
  unchanged behaviour when `--history` is not set.

### Added — v1.7 CI (complete)

- `revitcli check --output sarif` — SARIF 2.1.0 output suitable for
  `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif`. Element identity sits in
  `logicalLocations` and a `properties` bag (`revitElementId`,
  `revitCategory`, `revitParameter`, `revitCurrentValue`, `documentPath`),
  not in `physicalLocation` (Revit elements aren't files).
- `revitcli check --output pr-comment` — Markdown table sized for a PR
  comment, severity-grouped, truncated at 50 rows.
- `--report` extension inference now also recognizes `.sarif` and routes to
  the new writer.
- `revitcli ci doctor` — detect the running CI provider (GitHub Actions /
  GitLab / Jenkins / Azure DevOps / Travis / generic) via env vars and
  print a ready-to-paste workflow snippet. Exits 0 (informational).
- `revitcli check` now fires a webhook to `defaults.notify` (HTTPS-only,
  private/loopback hosts rejected) on completion, with payload
  `{ event: "check", name, passed, failed, suppressed, severityFailed,
  timestamp, profilePath }`. Best-effort: failure does not affect the
  check exit code. Mirrors the existing publish webhook.
- New composite GitHub Action at `.github/actions/revitcli-check/` — drops
  into any GitHub workflow to install the CLI, run `check --output sarif`,
  and upload to Code Scanning. See `docs/ci/github-actions.md`.

### Added — v1.9 profile governance (complete)

- `revitcli profile` command cluster:
  - `profile validate [--profile PATH]` — schema + reference-completeness
    + dead-rule checks. Reports `error` / `warning` / `info` lines; exits
    1 only on `error`.
  - `profile show --resolve [--profile PATH] [--output yaml|json]` —
    walks the `extends` chain via `ProfileResolver` and prints the
    merged effective profile, with a header comment listing the chain.
  - `profile diff <a> <b> [--output table|json|markdown]` — structural
    diff (added / removed / changed) under `checks.`, `publish.`,
    `presets.`, `defaults.` keys.
  - `profile install <git-url> [--ref <ref>] [--subpath <relative>]
    [--target <dir>] [--force]` — shallow-clones a remote profile
    bundle into `.revitcli/profiles/<name>@<ref>/` via LibGit2Sharp.
    Prints the resulting path + a suggested `extends:` line.
- **Multi-extends**: `extends:` now accepts an array (`extends: [base.yml,
  team.yml]`) in addition to the existing single-string form. Parents
  resolve left-to-right (later parents override earlier).
- **Deep-merge mode**: opt-in via `extendsStrategy: deep-merge` at the
  profile root. Dictionary entries (`checks.<name>`, `publish.<name>`,
  etc.) merge by key; conflicts use child-wins. Default remains
  `replace` for byte-identical backward compat.
- Cycle detection extended to multi-parent DAGs (a→b→c→a still throws).

### Added — v1.8 family management (foundation; purge / validate / export land in a follow-up)

- `revitcli family ls [--unused] [--category <name>] [--output table|json|csv]`
  — lists families in the active document.
- New addin endpoint `GET /api/families?unused=true|false&category=<name>`
  served by `FamiliesController`. Token auth applies as for every other
  endpoint.
- `IRevitOperations.ListFamiliesAsync(FamilyListRequest)` is additive —
  v1.7 add-ins paired with the v1.8 CLI return 404, which the client
  maps to a clear "endpoint requires v1.8 add-in" message.

### Added — v1.8 family management (CLI completion: validate / purge / export)

Closes the v1.8 family CLI surface. The CLI side ships in this PR with
fully mocked HTTP coverage; the corresponding Revit addin endpoints
(`POST /api/families/purge`, `POST /api/families/export`) land in a
Windows-only follow-up because the addin needs a live Revit session to
build and test against.

- `revitcli family validate [--category NAME] [--rules CSV] [--output table|json|csv] [--fail-on error|warning]`
  — built-in invariant checks: name-non-empty, name-no-path-chars,
  category-known, loadable-or-in-place. Default `--fail-on=error`
  matches `audit` semantics; warnings (placeholder category) do not
  fail CI by default.
- `revitcli family purge [--category NAME] [--keep CSV] [--apply] [--yes]`
  — drops families with zero placed instances. Default mode is dry-run
  (lists candidates); `--apply --yes` actually deletes. In-place
  families are filtered out client-side (Revit can't drop them as
  families). `--keep` accepts substring patterns to safelist by name.
  Audit log entry on apply (`action: "family-purge"`).
- `revitcli family export [--all|--category NAME|--name SUBSTR] [--output-dir DIR] [--overwrite] [--dry-run]`
  — saves families as standalone .rfa files. In-place and non-loadable
  families are filtered out. Partial failures exit 2 (consistent with
  other write commands). Audit log entry on apply.
- New shared DTOs: `FamilyPurgeRequest/Result`, `FamilyExportRequest/Result`,
  `FamilyValidationIssue` (shape mirrors `AuditIssue` so SARIF / dashboard
  consumers can lift the same fields without conditioning on source).
- `RevitClient.PurgeFamiliesAsync` / `ExportFamiliesAsync` added; both
  POST to the new family endpoints. Will return 404 against a v1.7
  addin until the Windows follow-up lands.

### Added — `family validate --output sarif`

Closes the CI integration story for v1.8 family validation. Previously
`audit --output sarif` produced SARIF for model-level checks but family
issues had no SARIF projection — they couldn't ride the same Code
Scanning ingestion pipeline. Now they can.

- New `family validate --output sarif` flag — same SARIF 2.1.0 envelope
  as `audit --output sarif`, so a CI consumer (GitHub Code Scanning,
  Azure DevOps SARIF importer, etc.) ingests both runs uniformly.
- New `SarifWriter.RenderFamilyValidation(IEnumerable<FamilyValidationIssue>)`
  — family-flavored projection: per-result `properties.revitFamilyId` /
  `revitFamilyName` / `revitCategory` / `documentPath`, logical
  locations as `family:<name>#<id>` with `kind: "family"` so a SARIF
  reader can disambiguate model-element issues from family issues.

### Added — MCP phase 2 (resources + safe writes)

- New MCP methods: `resources/list` and `resources/read`. Capabilities
  advertise `resources` when any are registered.
- 3 read-only resources:
  - `revitcli://snapshot/latest` (`application/json`) — fresh
    summary-only snapshot via the addin.
  - `revitcli://history/` (`application/json`) — recent snapshots from
    `HistoryStore` index.
  - `revitcli://profile/effective` (`text/yaml`) — resolved effective
    profile via `ProfileResolver`.
- New `snapshot` tool — read-only fresh capture for LLMs.
- New `set` tool — **double-gated** for safety:
  1. `mcp serve --allow-writes` flag must be set (server-side opt-in).
  2. Each call must include `confirm: true` in arguments (per-call opt-in).
  Without either, the tool returns a content-text refusal explaining how
  to enable. Defense in depth for LLM-driven model writes.

### Added — v2.0 dashboard (phase 1 — skeleton)

- New top-level dashboard project under `dashboard/` (SvelteKit +
  adapter-static + Tailwind + Chart.js). Phase 1 ships:
  - Project skeleton with pinned dependency versions (Node ≥ 20, npm
    ≥ 10). No `npm install` is run at check-in time — users run their
    own.
  - Overview page (current score, element-counts, 7-day sparkline
    placeholder div). Charts and Multi-project view land in a v2.0
    follow-up.
  - History loader via `?history=` query param or `/data/history.json`
    fallback.
- `revitcli dashboard serve [--port 8080] [--history-dir .revitcli/history]`
  — localhost-only static-file server backed by `HttpListener` (BCL,
  no new NuGet). Refuses to start if `dashboard/build/` is missing
  with a clear message.
- `revitcli dashboard build --output ./public [--history-dir <dir>]
  [--force]` — copies the prebuilt dashboard + injects the user's
  history index into `public/data/history.json`. Refuses to overwrite
  a non-empty output dir without `--force`.

### Added — v2.1 step 1: `profile simulate <pipeline>`

First step of the v2.1 "Configuration Confidence" milestone (see
`docs/v2.1-roadmap.md`). Closes the gap between schema lint and
runtime errors: `profile validate` checks that the YAML parses;
`profile simulate <name>` walks the publish pipeline as if it were
about to run, without contacting Revit, and reports reference
completeness + surface concerns.

- New CLI command `revitcli profile simulate <pipeline>
  [--profile PATH] [--output table|json] [--fail-on info|warning|error]`.
- Static analysis surfaces:
  - **error** — preset name not defined; precheck name not defined;
    preset has no `format`.
  - **warning** — preset uses an unknown format (not dwg|pdf|ifc);
    preset has neither sheets nor views; precheck has no rules.
  - **info** — preset uses `sheets: ALL` (full-document export,
    confirm intent).
- Aggregates ALL rule sources of a check into the precheck report
  (auditRules + requiredParameters + naming) — not just the literal
  `auditRules:` list. Operators see what the precheck actually
  exercises.
- Webhook URL, incremental-publish settings, and baseline path
  surface in the report so the operator sees the full runtime
  surface in one place.
- New `docs/v2.1-roadmap.md` lays out the v2.1 plan: this step (✅),
  multi-Revit-version smoke matrix (next), and journal signing /
  verify (last).

### Added — v2.0 dashboard (phase 2 — Chart.js + History page)

Per `docs/roadmap-2026q2-q3.md` §7. Phase 1 shipped the skeleton +
data layer + Overview shell with placeholder DOM; phase 2 swaps in
real Chart.js charts and adds the dedicated History route.

- New shared chart components under `dashboard/src/lib/charts/`:
  - `CategoryBarChart.svelte` — horizontal bar chart for "elements
    per category" on Overview. Uses `indexAxis: 'y'` because category
    names ("Specialty Equipment", "Generic Models") need horizontal
    space the vertical layout truncates. Auto-sizes its height with
    row count so dense models still render every bar.
  - `ScoreSparkline.svelte` — score-over-time line chart. Default is
    minimal mode (no axes / grid) for the Overview's "last 7
    captures" widget; History page passes `minimal={false}` to surface
    the full y-axis 0–100.
  - `registerCharts.ts` — idempotent global Chart.js registration so
    SSR (svelte-kit's prerender) doesn't try to touch `window`.
- New `/history` route — full time-series chart over every captured
  snapshot + a delta table that compares each capture to the
  immediately previous one (Δscore, Δelements). Reads from the same
  `loadHistory()` source as Overview; no extra fetch. For a full
  element-by-element diff between two captures, the table footer
  points the operator at `revitcli history diff`.
- Layout enables the History nav link (was disabled in phase 1).
  Multi-project remains the only disabled link, marked for a v2.0
  follow-up.
- C# side unchanged: `dashboard serve` already handles SPA fallback
  for any extension-less path (`/history` → `index.html`), so no
  routing changes were needed.

### Added — v2.0 dashboard (Multi-project route — last §7 in-scope item)

Closes the v2.0 §7 range (In) checklist: the `/projects` route the
layout was previously advertising as disabled is now live, and the
CLI grew the supporting `dashboard build --project NAME:DIR` plumbing.

CLI — `revitcli dashboard build`
- New repeatable flag `--project NAME:DIR` (e.g. `--project
  "Office:./projA/.revitcli/history"`). Splits on the FIRST colon so
  Windows drive paths (`Office:C:\proj\hist`) survive intact. Names
  are case-insensitively unique within the run; duplicates fail fast.
- Orthogonal to `--history-dir`: pass both for the single-project
  Overview/History routes AND the multi-project comparison in one
  build. Pass neither for the v2.0 phase 1 default.
- New private writer `InjectProjectsAsync` builds
  `data/projects.json` of shape `{ version, projects: [{ name,
  historyDir, history }] }`. A missing or malformed per-project
  `index.json` becomes an inline placeholder so the build never
  blocks on one bad input — the dashboard renders a "0 captures"
  card instead.

Dashboard — `dashboard/`
- `src/lib/loadProjects.ts` — fetcher mirroring `loadHistory.ts`:
  `?projects=<url>` query param → `/data/projects.json` →
  `STUB_PROJECTS` fallback. Plus a `latestSummary(p)` helper that
  the route uses for card-level projection.
- `src/routes/projects/+page.svelte` — responsive grid (1 → 2 → 3
  columns) of project cards. Each card carries name, current score,
  element count, capture count, and a 7-capture sparkline reusing
  `ScoreSparkline`. Sorted by current score DESC, ties broken by
  name for determinism.
- Layout enables the `/projects` nav link (was disabled in phase 1
  + phase 2). All three v2.0 routes are now live.

### Added — v2.0 dashboard GitHub Pages deploy template

Per `docs/roadmap-2026q2-q3.md` §7 implementation step 9. Operators
who want to publish their dashboard get a SHA-pinned, ready-to-paste
workflow + a privacy-conscious operator guide.

- `docs/ci/dashboard-deploy-template.yml` — copy to
  `.github/workflows/dashboard-deploy.yml`. Builds the SvelteKit SPA,
  runs `revitcli dashboard build` to inject `history.json` (and
  optionally one or more `--project NAME:DIR` for the Multi-project
  route), uploads via `actions/upload-pages-artifact`, deploys via
  `actions/deploy-pages`. Concurrency-gated on the `pages` group so
  parallel pushes don't race the deploy lock. All third-party `uses`
  are SHA-pinned with version-label comments.
- `docs/ci/dashboard-github-pages.md` — the operator guide. Covers
  the privacy story up front (the dashboard's `app.html` already
  carries `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`, but a public
  deploy is still publicly fetchable; pointers to the Pages-from-
  private-repo flow), the `BASE_PATH` adjustments for project / user /
  custom-domain Pages, what `dashboard build` writes into `data/`,
  optional site-wide `static/robots.txt`, and the SHA-pin update
  workflow.
- `docs/ci/github-actions.md` cross-links the new doc.

### Added — v2.0 dashboard Playwright e2e (closes §7 step 10)

Per `docs/roadmap-2026q2-q3.md` §7 implementation step 10. Smoke
coverage for all three v2.0 routes; stub-data driven so the suite
runs from a fresh checkout with no operator history.

- `dashboard/playwright.config.ts` — single Chromium project,
  `webServer` launches `npm run dev` automatically. CI gets
  `forbidOnly`, fewer retries, GitHub reporter; local devs get the
  default `list` reporter and reused-server semantics.
- `dashboard/tests/e2e/`:
  - `overview.spec.ts` — header, demo-data badge, both Chart.js
    mounts (bar + sparkline), full nav surface
  - `history.spec.ts` — heading, time-series chart, delta table row
    count, Δscore column rendering
  - `projects.spec.ts` — card count, score-DESC sort order, per-card
    sparkline mount, score / elements / captures labels
  - `README.md` — run instructions + strategy notes
- `dashboard/package.json` — adds `@playwright/test` devDep + two
  scripts (`test:e2e`, `test:e2e:install`)
- `dashboard/.gitignore` — adds `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`,
  `playwright/.cache/`

Strategy: every assertion targets `data-test-id` hooks rather than
display copy, and pins SHAPE (counts, presence) rather than VALUES
(specific scores) so a future stub-data tweak or copy revision
doesn't break the suite.

### Added — MCP adapter (side track, unchanged)

- `revitcli mcp serve` — Model Context Protocol stdio server (spec
  `2024-11-05`). Exposes 3 read-only tools: `status`, `query`, `audit`.
  Use in `claude_desktop_config.json` as
  `"revitcli": { "command": "revitcli", "args": ["mcp", "serve"] }`. Write
  tools (`set` / `import` / `fix` / `rollback`) deferred pending a safety
  review of LLM-driven model writes.

### Added — post-audit follow-ups

- `revitcli export --dry-run` now actually parses: validates inputs and resolves
  sheet/view selectors but writes zero files; previously the README documented
  the flag while the parser rejected it.

### Fixed — post-audit follow-ups

- `revitcli doctor` now honors the `Revit<year>InstallDir` env var (Autodesk
  convention used by the addin csproj) when looking for `RevitAPI.dll`, so
  installs at non-default locations no longer trigger a false `FAIL`. The
  diagnostic message reports the path actually checked.

### Internal — repo hygiene and security hardening (no user-facing API changes)

- **Build**: centralized version (`Directory.Build.props` → `RevitCliVersion`) and
  central NuGet management (`Directory.Packages.props`). `TreatWarningsAsErrors`
  now enabled across all projects.
- **Add-in security**: API token now derives from `RandomNumberGenerator` (32 random
  bytes, hex) instead of `Guid.NewGuid()`. `~/.revitcli/server.json` is ACL-locked
  to the current Windows user (FullControl only, inheritance disabled) on write.
- **Add-in robustness**: `RemoveServerInfo` no longer leaks foreign server entries
  (`&&` → `||` ownership check). Port-bind retry, atomic write, and run-task
  observation now log narrowly-typed exceptions to stderr instead of swallowing
  them silently. `Thread.Sleep` retain-loop kept (already async-safe outside the
  Revit UI thread).
- **Add-in `/api/export`**: path traversal check now uses `Path.GetFullPath`
  canonicalization + `StartsWith(userProfile)` instead of a literal `..`
  substring search. Validated against 8 attack/legit cases.
- **Add-in `set`**: display→internal unit conversion failures now surface as
  `400` with a clear message instead of silently writing the raw value.
- **CLI HTTP**: default `HttpClient.Timeout` is 30s (override via
  `REVITCLI_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, clamped 1-3600). Previously implicit 100s.
- **CLI**: bare catches in `RevitClient.DiscoverServerUrl`, `CliConfig.Load`,
  and `JournalLogger.Log` narrowed and surfaced to stderr.
- **CLI**: shared `ServerInfo.DefaultPort` constant removes 3-way port
  hardcoding between addin, client, and config.
- **CI**: actions pinned to commit SHA. CLI `ci.yml` now matrices on
  ubuntu-latest × windows-latest. `ci-addin.yml` triggers on PR (paths
  filter) plus a daily 02:00 cron, no longer dispatch-only. `release.yml`
  drops `continue-on-error: true` from per-Revit-year add-in builds.
- **Tests**: `Fix_Apply_FailsWhenBaselineCannotBeSavedAndSkipsSet` reworked
  to use a cross-platform invalid baseline path (was Windows-only via `<>`).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- `revitcli fix` for dry-run and apply of profile-driven parameter fixes.
- `revitcli rollback` for journal-scoped restoration of fix changes.
- Structured `AuditIssue` metadata for fix planning.
- `setParam` and `renameByPattern` strategies.

### Out of scope

- Delete, geometry, family editing, and cross-document fixes.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-24

Model-as-Code Phase 3 — `revitcli import FILE.csv`. Closes the loop: snapshot
(P1) reads the model, publish --since (P2) re-exports only what changed, and
import (P3) writes parameter values back from CSV in batched transactions.

### Added — CSV import

- **`revitcli import FILE.csv`** — declarative bulk parameter writeback.
  Required: `--category` (e.g. `doors`, `墙`), `--match-by` (e.g. `Mark`).
  Optional: `--map "col:Param,col2:Param2"` (default identity), `--dry-run`,
  `--on-missing error|warn|skip` (default `warn`),
  `--on-duplicate error|first|all` (default `error`),
  `--encoding utf-8|gbk|auto` (default `auto`),
  `--batch-size N` (default 100, max 1000).
  Exit codes: 0 (success / dry-run / no rows), 1 (setup / parse / IO / fatal
  miss-or-dup), 2 (some groups failed at write time).
- **`Output/CsvParser`** — RFC 4180 parser with auto encoding detection:
  BOM (UTF-8 / UTF-16 LE / UTF-16 BE) → strict UTF-8 → GBK fallback. Required
  because Excel-exported Chinese CSV is GBK by default. Handles quoted values,
  escaped doubled-quotes, embedded commas/newlines, CRLF or LF.
- **`Output/CsvMapping`** — parses `--map` into a column→param dict;
  unspecified columns default to identity; `--match-by` column excluded from
  writes. Throws on malformed pairs or unknown columns.
- **`Output/ImportPlanner`** — pure-C# matching + grouping algorithm. Indexes
  Revit elements by trimmed `--match-by` value (case-sensitive ordinal),
  classifies CSV rows into Misses / Duplicates / Skipped per `--on-missing`
  and `--on-duplicate`, groups final writes by `(param, value)` so each
  unique pair becomes one batched `SetRequest`. Last-write-wins on repeated
  `(element, param)` with one warning per conflicting key.
- **`Commands/ImportCommand`** — orchestrator that wires CSV → mapping →
  query → planner → batched `SetParameter`. Single code path (TTY and pipe
  both produce plain text — `import` output is mostly counts).
- **`tests/RevitCli.Tests/TestInit.cs`** — `[ModuleInitializer]` registers
  `CodePagesEncodingProvider` once at test-assembly load so test code that
  builds GBK input via `Encoding.GetEncoding("gbk")` works without per-class
  fixture boilerplate.
- **Shell completions for import** — bash, zsh, and PowerShell tab-complete
  `--match-by`, `--map`, `--on-missing`, `--on-duplicate`, `--encoding`, plus
  static value lists for the latter three.

### Changed

- `src/RevitCli/Program.cs`: registers `CodePagesEncodingProvider` at startup
  so `Encoding.GetEncoding("gbk")` works on .NET 8 / Linux for production use.
- `src/RevitCli/RevitCli.csproj`: adds `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages 9.0.0`.
- `src/RevitCli/Commands/CliCommandCatalog.cs`: registers `import` in
  `TopLevelCommands`, `CreateRootCommand`, and `InteractiveHelpEntries`.

### Backward compatibility

- No changes to existing commands, profiles, DTOs, or addin endpoints.
- `import` reuses the existing `/api/elements` (query) and `/api/elements/set`
  (write) endpoints — **no addin upgrade required**. Users on v1.2.0 addin
  - v1.3.0 CLI gain `import` immediately.

### Test count

- 42 new facts across 4 new files + 3 completions assertions in the existing
  `CompletionsCommandTests`. CLI test suite total: **253** (was 211 after P2).
- New facts: `CsvParserTests` × 12, `CsvMappingTests` × 6,
  `ImportPlannerTests` × 12, `ImportCommandTests` × 12.

### End-to-end verification (manual — Windows + Revit 2026)

To verify on a live Revit:

1. Open a model with at least 3 doors; set `Mark` = `W01`, `W02`, `W03`.
2. Write `doors.csv` (UTF-8):
   ```
   Mark,锁具型号
   W01,YALE-500
   W02,YALE-700
   W03,YALE-500
   ```
3. `revitcli import doors.csv --category doors --match-by Mark --dry-run` →
   expect `groups=2, elementWrites=3` and per-group preview.
4. `revitcli import doors.csv --category doors --match-by Mark` →
   expect `Modified 3 element-parameter pair(s) across 2 group(s)`.
5. `revitcli query doors` → confirm `锁具型号` populated per CSV.
6. Re-save the same CSV from Excel as GBK and re-run; expect
   `encoding=gbk` line in plan summary and identical write outcome.

### Known Carry-forward

- Items already noted in v1.2.0 (Revit 2024 build compat for new `ElementId`
  ctor unverified, `--verbose` / `--severity` unimplemented, no progress
  signal during snapshot, README.md still v1.0.0 lineage).
- `import` writes only existing parameters: if the CSV references a Revit
  parameter that does not exist on the target element, the addin's `set`
  returns success with `Affected = 0` for that element. Treat 0 affected as
  a soft signal; surfacing this distinctly is a future enhancement.
- No interactive Spectre.Console table rendering for `import` results — TTY
  and pipe both emit plain text. Acceptable because `import` output is
  primarily counts.
- Duplicate CSV column names (e.g. two columns both named `Lock`) produce
  last-column-wins behavior with a warning. Users should rename their CSV
  headers if they hit this.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-23

Model-as-Code Phase 2 — incremental publish. Pairs `publish --since` with the
snapshot/diff infrastructure from v1.1.0 so a 50-sheet project can re-export
only the 3 sheets that changed, not the whole set.

### Added

- **`revitcli publish --since SNAPSHOT`** — diff a baseline snapshot against
  the current model and narrow each export preset's sheet selector to only the
  changed sheets. Options: `--since-mode content|meta` (default content),
  `--update-baseline` (rewrite the baseline on successful publish).
- **Profile `publish.<pipeline>.incremental: true`** — enable incremental
  publish by default. Baseline path defaults to `.revitcli/last-publish.json`
  and can be overridden with `publish.<pipeline>.baselinePath: <path>`.
  `sinceMode: content|meta` picks the diff granularity.
- **`SnapshotSheet.ContentHash`** — now populated (empty in v1.1.0). For each
  sheet, hashes its `MetaHash` + the element hashes of every non-type element
  in scope of each placed view. Skipped in `--summary-only` mode.
- **`SnapshotHasher.HashSheetContent`** — stable hash helper for sheet
  content, shared between CLI and addin.
- **`BaselineManager`** — atomic read/write of baseline snapshot files
  (tmp-then-rename via `File.Move(overwrite: true)`), used by publish to
  persist the post-publish state.
- **`SinceMode` enum** — content vs meta; used by `SnapshotDiffer.Diff`'s new
  optional `sinceMode` parameter.
- **Shell completions for publish** — `--since`, `--since-mode`, and
  `--update-baseline` now tab-complete in bash, zsh, and PowerShell.

### Changed

- **`SnapshotDiffer.Diff`** — new signature accepts `SinceMode sinceMode =
SinceMode.Meta`. Existing callers (v1.1.0 `revitcli diff` command) keep
  MetaHash-only behavior; new P2 call sites pass `SinceMode.Content`
  explicitly. A P1 baseline (empty ContentHash) falls back to MetaHash
  comparison automatically — no schema bump, no forced baseline rebuild.
- **Publish receipts / webhook payloads** now include `incremental` (bool)
  and `changedSheets` (int) fields when `--since` or `incremental: true` is
  active.

### Backward compatibility

- `schemaVersion` stays at `1`. A v1.1.0 baseline diffs cleanly against a
  v1.2.0 snapshot (content mode gracefully degrades to meta for sheets where
  either side has empty ContentHash).
- `revitcli diff` command output format unchanged.
- `revitcli snapshot` output is byte-identical for sheet MetaHash; only
  `contentHash` field transitions from `""` to real hashes.

### Known Carry-forward

- ContentHash does not honor Visibility/Graphics overrides — hiding a wall
  via V/G won't change `ContentHash`. This is intentional for performance;
  documented on `SnapshotSheet.ContentHash`.
- No progress signal during snapshot. Typical 100-sheet model should complete
  in <30s; if you hit this limit, open an issue.
- `--verbose` on `snapshot` and `--severity` on `diff` still unimplemented
  (carry-forward from v1.1.0).
- Revit 2024 (`-p:RevitYear=2024`, net48) build compat for the new
  `new ElementId(long)` call in `ComputeSheetContentHash` not verified —
  all existing call sites in the codebase use the same pattern and were
  presumed compiling in 2024 builds; needs a controller-driven test before
  a 2024 release. Revit 2026 verified end-to-end.

### End-to-end verification

Built on a real Revit 2026 model (9 walls, 9 doors, 2 windows, 16 schedules,
1 sheet added for this test). Snapshot writes non-empty contentHash. No-change
incremental publish prints "no sheets changed". After renaming the test
sheet, incremental publish correctly narrows the export to just that one
sheet.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-23

Model-as-Code Phase 1 — snapshot + diff infrastructure. This lays the
foundation for incremental publish (v1.2) and CSV import (v1.3).

### Added

- **`revitcli snapshot`** — capture the model's semantic state as JSON:
  elements grouped by category, sheets, schedules, and a counts summary.
  Options: `--output FILE`, `--categories LIST`, `--no-sheets`,
  `--no-schedules`, `--summary-only` (fast path, counts only).
- **`revitcli diff FROM TO`** — diff two snapshot JSONs. Formats:
  `table` (default), `json`, `markdown`. Options: `--report FILE`
  (format inferred from `.md`/`.json` extension), `--categories LIST`,
  `--max-rows N`. Errors on schema version mismatch; warns on
  DocumentPath mismatch.
- **Shared DTOs** (`shared/RevitCli.Shared/`):
  `ModelSnapshot`, `SnapshotRequest`, `SnapshotDiff` with every property
  carrying `[JsonPropertyName("camelCase")]` attributes for stable wire
  format.
- **`SnapshotHasher`** — pure static helper producing stable 16-char
  SHA256 hashes for elements, sheet metadata, and schedules. Sorts
  parameter keys Ordinally and escapes `\n`, `\`, `|` in values to
  prevent collisions.
- **`SnapshotDiffer`** — pure C# diff algorithm. Elements keyed by Id
  within each category, sheets by Number, schedules by Id. Defensively
  dedupes via `GroupBy().First()` so malformed input produces a clean
  diff instead of a raw `ArgumentException`.
- **`DiffRenderer`** — renders diffs as table / json / markdown with
  truncation at `--max-rows` and pipe-escape protection for Markdown
  table cells.
- **Addin endpoint** — `POST /api/snapshot` via `SnapshotController`
  wired into `RealRevitOperations.CaptureSnapshotAsync` (runs on the
  Revit main thread through `RevitBridge`). Full Revit API traversal:
  `FilteredElementCollector.OfCategory(...)` for elements,
  `OfClass(typeof(ViewSheet))` for sheets,
  `OfClass(typeof(ViewSchedule))` for schedules with body-cell hash.
- **48 new tests** across shared/CLI layers: DTO roundtrip, hash
  stability, diff algorithm edge cases, renderer formatting, CLI
  commands, and HTTP client wiring.

### Deferred to Phase 2 (v1.2)

- `SnapshotSheet.ContentHash` — view-level element aggregation for
  "sheet really changed?" detection. Currently left as empty string.
- `revitcli publish --since SNAPSHOT` — incremental re-export of only
  sheets whose content changed since the baseline.
- Profile `publish.incremental: true` flag + baseline auto-management.

### Known Carry-forward

- Addin test project (`tests/RevitCli.Addin.Tests/`) has pre-existing
  compile errors against Revit 2026 API (`UIApplication` reference
  missing in test csproj). Not caused by this release; flagged for a
  separate `chore: restore addin tests` commit.
- `--verbose` flag on the `snapshot` command is specified in the design
  doc but not yet implemented.
- `--severity added|removed|modified|all` flag on the `diff` command is
  specified in the design doc but not yet implemented. Workaround:
  filter by category with `--categories` or post-process the JSON
  output.
- `snapshot` / `diff` do not yet appear in the interactive REPL help
  listing (`CliCommandCatalog.InteractiveHelpEntries`) or in the
  shell-completion option-per-command blocks. Top-level command
  completion works.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-04

RevitCli v1.0 — production-ready local BIMOps runner for Revit teams.

### Added

- **`revitcli init`** — interactive profile creation from 3 starter templates

- **Publish receipts** — `.revitcli/receipts/<pipeline>-<timestamp>.json` with profile hash, user, machine
- **15 commands total**: status, query, set, audit, export, check, publish, init, score, coverage, config, doctor, batch, completions, interactive

### Changed

- PDF export: no sheets + no views → actionable error instead of exporting all views
- Starter profiles embedded in CLI package (init works from installed tool)
- Publish receipt includes profileHash for auto-discovered profiles

### Production Readiness

- 122 tests (contract tests, integration tests, validation tests)
- 10 built-in audit rules + 2 profile-driven checks
- Documentation website with 5 pages
- 3 starter profiles (architectural, interior, general)
- Supports Revit 2024/2025/2026
- Install scripts, GitHub Actions release workflow
- Output contracts locked (JSON, HTML, exit codes, webhook payload)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Documentation website** (GitHub Pages, dark theme)
  - Quick Start guide, 3 core workflows, profile reference, troubleshooting
  - Live at https://xiaodream551-a11y.github.io/revitcli/

- **3 starter profiles** (`profiles/`)
  - `architectural-issue.yml` — room data, sheet completeness, pre-issue gate
  - `interior-room-data.yml` — room metadata, naming, FM handover
  - `general-publish.yml` — health checks, DWG/PDF/IFC pipelines

- **Doctor onboarding** — quickstart guidance when no profile detected
- **34 new tests** (86 → 122) — check command, journal, diff engine, output contracts, profile validation

### Changed

- Profile inheritance: `defaults.Notify` now properly inherited from parent
- Error messages are actionable (suggest fixes, list available options)
- `set --ids-from <file>` for Windows pipe workaround
- Malformed `--ids-from` input rejected with clear error (not silent partial)
- Publish suggests 'revitcli doctor' on connection failure

### Fixed

- Placeholder contract tests replaced with real assertions
- ParseIds tests exercise actual parser path

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Pipe composability**
  - `set --stdin`: read element IDs from stdin (JSON array or one per line)
  - `set --ids-from <file>`: read element IDs from JSON file (Windows-friendly)
  - `SetRequest.ElementIds`: batch element ID list for pipe workflows
  - Strict parsing with clear error messages on malformed input

- **Webhook notifications**
  - `defaults.notify` in `.revitcli.yml`: HTTPS URL to POST results
  - Fires after `check` and `publish` with status, counts, timestamp
  - HTTPS-only for security, non-blocking (errors to stderr)

- **Operation journal**
  - `.revitcli/journal.jsonl`: append-only log of `set` and `publish` operations
  - Records: action, parameters, affected count, user, timestamp
  - Both interactive and non-interactive paths log consistently

### Known Issues

- `--stdin` pipe does not work reliably with PowerShell + `dotnet run`; use `--ids-from` instead
- `--ids-from` has a serialization issue with the add-in API; use category+filter or --id for now

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **6 new audit rules** (total: 10 built-in + 2 profile-driven)
  - `views-not-on-sheets` — printable views/schedules not placed on sheets
  - `imported-dwg` — imported (not linked) CAD files
  - `in-place-families` — in-place families that should be loadable
  - `duplicate-room-numbers` — rooms sharing the same number
  - `room-metadata` — rooms missing number or using default name
  - `sheets-missing-info` — sheets with no number or empty content

- **Check result diff engine**
  - Auto-saves results to `.revitcli/results/` after each check run
  - Compares against previous run: reports new, resolved, unchanged issues
  - `--no-save` flag to skip storage (used by publish precheck)

### Changed

- **Naming rule rewritten**: replaced broad regex with prefix-based detection
  using known Revit default view prefixes (English + Chinese + German + French).
  System names like "标高 1" / "Level 1" are now whitelisted and no longer flagged.
- `views-not-on-sheets` and `sheets-missing-info` account for `ScheduleSheetInstance`
  placements (schedules on sheets are not false positives)
- `audit --list` output generated from rule registry (no more stale hardcoded strings)
- Diff output only appears in table format (JSON/HTML remain clean for CI parsers)
- Result storage wrapped in try/catch (I/O failures don't break audit output)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Project Profiles** (`.revitcli.yml`)
  - Named check sets with audit rules, required parameter checks, naming patterns
  - Named export presets (format, sheets/views, output directory)
  - Named publish pipelines with precheck gates
  - Single-parent inheritance via `extends` with cycle detection
  - Validation of `failOn` and `severity` values at load time

- **`revitcli check`** — Run project checks from profile
  - Sends all checks in single request to add-in (fast batch execution)
  - `--output table|json|html` for different consumers
  - `--report <file>` to save reports (format inferred from extension)
  - Exit code based on `failOn` (error/warning) for CI gating
  - Suppression/waiver system: by rule, category, parameter, element IDs, with expiry dates

- **`revitcli publish`** — Run export pipelines from profile
  - Optional precheck gate (runs a check set first)
  - Sequential export preset execution
  - `--dry-run` support
  - Output paths resolved relative to profile file

- **Check Report Renderer**
  - Table (plain text), JSON (CI), HTML (dark mode with summary cards)
  - All formats display suppressed issue count

- **Server-side audit extensions**
  - `required-parameter`: batch check per category with duplicate-aware parameter scan
  - `naming-pattern`: custom regex patterns for views, sheets, or any category

- **Multi-version Revit support**
  - Dual TFM: `net48` (Revit 2024) + `net8.0-windows` (Revit 2025/2026)
  - `RevitYear` build parameter with per-year output directories
  - Element IDs widened from `int` to `long` (64-bit ElementId since Revit 2024)

- **Capability/version model**
  - `status` reports `revitYear`, `addinVersion`, and `capabilities` list
  - CLI displays add-in version and capabilities

- **Installer**
  - `install.ps1`: auto-detects Revit years, per-year add-in deployment, PATH setup
  - `uninstall.ps1`: multi-year manifest removal, optional `-Purge`
  - `release.yml`: GitHub Actions builds per Revit year, packages ZIP with checksum

- **`doctor`** now displays detected `.revitcli.yml` profile info

### Changed

- Release notes derive supported Revit years from actual build outcomes
- Profile inheritance documented as full-object replacement (not deep merge)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Real Revit API Integration (Revit 2026)**
  - `status` — Returns actual Revit version and active document info
  - `query --id` — Fetch real elements by ElementId
  - `query <category> --filter` — Category collection with typed filter matching, unit conversion, duplicate parameter handling
  - `set` — Parameter modification with Transaction safety, type coercion (String/Integer/Double/ElementId), `--dry-run` with full validation, all-or-nothing semantics
  - `audit` — 4 real rules: `naming`, `room-bounds`, `level-consistency`, `unplaced-rooms`
  - `export` — DWG/PDF per-view/sheet export with wildcard matching, IFC whole-model export

- **Add-in Architecture**
  - `IExternalApplication` + `ExternalEvent` bridge for safe main-thread access
  - `RealRevitOperations` with real Revit API calls
  - Exception mapping in controllers (ArgumentException->400, InvalidOperationException->409)
  - Transaction commit status verification
  - Export return value checking

- **CLI Enhancements**
  - `--views` option for export command
  - Category aliases in English + Chinese (walls/墙, doors/门, etc.)
  - Duplicate parameter disambiguation via `[N]` suffix in both query and set

### Changed

- Removed `clash` audit rule (placeholder; deferred to future release)
- Controllers now return structured JSON errors instead of HTTP 500

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **CLI Commands (10)**
  - `revitcli status` — Check Revit plugin connection status
  - `revitcli query` — Query elements by category, filter, or ID with table/JSON/CSV output
  - `revitcli export` — Batch export sheets as DWG, PDF, or IFC with progress bar
  - `revitcli set` — Modify element parameters with `--dry-run` preview
  - `revitcli audit` — Run model checking rules
  - `revitcli config` — View and modify CLI configuration (`config show` / `config set`)
  - `revitcli doctor` — Diagnose setup issues and connection problems
  - `revitcli completions` — Generate shell completion scripts (bash/zsh/PowerShell)
  - `revitcli interactive` — Interactive REPL mode (`-i` shortcut)
  - `revitcli batch` — Execute commands from a JSON file

- **Revit Add-in**
  - Embedded HTTP server (EmbedIO) with REST API
  - `IRevitOperations` interface separating business logic from HTTP handlers
  - Port fallback mechanism (tries 10 ports if default is occupied)
  - Server discovery via `~/.revitcli/server.json` with PID validation

- **Developer Experience**
  - Spectre.Console colored output with automatic TTY detection
  - Pipe-friendly plain text fallback when stdout is redirected
  - `--version` and `--verbose` global options
  - Configuration system (`~/.revitcli/config.json`)
  - Non-zero exit codes on command errors
  - Packaged as .NET global tool (`dotnet tool install --global RevitCli`)
  - GitHub Actions CI (build + test on push/PR)
  - NuGet auto-publish workflow on tag push
  - 86 unit, integration, and protocol tests
