# Changelog

All notable changes to RevitCli will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — v1.6 history (complete)

- `revitcli history` command cluster — local snapshot timeline under
  `.revitcli/history/`, gzip-compressed:
  - `history init` — create the store + empty index.
  - `history capture [--source manual|cron|fix-baseline] [--exclude-fixes]` —
    take a snapshot via the addin and append to the timeline.
  - `history list [--include-fixes] [--limit N]` — table view of recent
    snapshots (id, capturedAt, source, elementCount, size).
  - `history prune --keep <duration|count> [--dry-run] [--apply]` — drop old
    entries; fix-baseline snapshots are protected by default.
  - `history diff <fromRef> <toRef> [--output table|json|markdown]
    [--max-rows N] [--categories LIST]` — diff two snapshots resolved from
    the timeline; reuses the v1.1 `SnapshotDiffer` + `DiffRenderer`.
  - `history trend [--metric <name>] [--window <duration>] [--width N]` —
    ASCII sparkline (`▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█`) + per-point row over a rolling window.
    Default metric `score`, default window `30d`, default width 60. Other
    supported metrics: `elements.<category>`, `sheets`, `schedules`,
    `count.<key>`.
  - Time references parse `@-N` (Nth most recent), ISO 8601 timestamps, and
    durations like `7d` / `24h` / `30m`.
- `revitcli score --history <duration>` — per-day score time series
  (LAST snapshot of each day) with new / resolved / unchanged columns;
  unchanged behaviour when `--history` is not set.

### Added — v1.7 CI (complete)

- `revitcli check --output sarif` — SARIF 2.1.0 output suitable for
  `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif`. Element identity sits in
  `logicalLocations` and a `properties` bag (`revitElementId`,
  `revitCategory`, `revitParameter`, `revitCurrentValue`, `documentPath`),
  not in `physicalLocation` (Revit elements aren't files).
- `revitcli check --output pr-comment` — Markdown table sized for a PR
  comment, severity-grouped, truncated at 50 rows.
- `--report` extension inference now also recognizes `.sarif` and routes to
  the new writer.
- `revitcli ci doctor` — detect the running CI provider (GitHub Actions /
  GitLab / Jenkins / Azure DevOps / Travis / generic) via env vars and
  print a ready-to-paste workflow snippet. Exits 0 (informational).
- `revitcli check` now fires a webhook to `defaults.notify` (HTTPS-only,
  private/loopback hosts rejected) on completion, with payload
  `{ event: "check", name, passed, failed, suppressed, severityFailed,
  timestamp, profilePath }`. Best-effort: failure does not affect the
  check exit code. Mirrors the existing publish webhook.
- New composite GitHub Action at `.github/actions/revitcli-check/` — drops
  into any GitHub workflow to install the CLI, run `check --output sarif`,
  and upload to Code Scanning. See `docs/ci/github-actions.md`.
- **Sticky PR comment bot** in the same composite action: on
  `pull_request` events the action additionally generates the markdown
  via `--output pr-comment` and posts (or updates) a single comment on
  the PR. Subsequent pushes update the comment in place — the action
  finds it by the hidden `<!-- revitcli-pr-comment -->` marker that
  `PrCommentWriter` now prepends to every render. New action inputs
  `pr-comment` (default `'true'`) and `github-token` (default
  `${{ github.token }}`); job needs `pull-requests: write` permission.
  Pass `pr-comment: 'false'` to opt out without losing the SARIF upload.

### Added — v1.9 profile governance (complete)

- `revitcli profile` command cluster:
  - `profile validate [--profile PATH]` — schema + reference-completeness
    + dead-rule checks. Reports `error` / `warning` / `info` lines; exits
    1 only on `error`.
  - `profile show --resolve [--profile PATH] [--output yaml|json]` —
    walks the `extends` chain via `ProfileResolver` and prints the
    merged effective profile, with a header comment listing the chain.
  - `profile diff <a> <b> [--output table|json|markdown]` — structural
    diff (added / removed / changed) under `checks.`, `publish.`,
    `presets.`, `defaults.` keys.
  - `profile install <git-url> [--ref <ref>] [--subpath <relative>]
    [--target <dir>] [--force]` — shallow-clones a remote profile
    bundle into `.revitcli/profiles/<name>@<ref>/` via LibGit2Sharp.
    Prints the resulting path + a suggested `extends:` line.
- **Multi-extends**: `extends:` now accepts an array (`extends: [base.yml,
  team.yml]`) in addition to the existing single-string form. Parents
  resolve left-to-right (later parents override earlier).
- **Deep-merge mode**: opt-in via `extendsStrategy: deep-merge` at the
  profile root. Dictionary entries (`checks.<name>`, `publish.<name>`,
  etc.) merge by key; conflicts use child-wins. Default remains
  `replace` for byte-identical backward compat.
- Cycle detection extended to multi-parent DAGs (a→b→c→a still throws).

### Added — v1.8 family management (foundation; purge / validate / export land in a follow-up)

- `revitcli family ls [--unused] [--category <name>] [--output table|json|csv]`
  — lists families in the active document.
- New addin endpoint `GET /api/families?unused=true|false&category=<name>`
  served by `FamiliesController`. Token auth applies as for every other
  endpoint.
- `IRevitOperations.ListFamiliesAsync(FamilyListRequest)` is additive —
  v1.7 add-ins paired with the v1.8 CLI return 404, which the client
  maps to a clear "endpoint requires v1.8 add-in" message.

### Added — MCP phase 2 (resources + safe writes)

- New MCP methods: `resources/list` and `resources/read`. Capabilities
  advertise `resources` when any are registered.
- 3 read-only resources:
  - `revitcli://snapshot/latest` (`application/json`) — fresh
    summary-only snapshot via the addin.
  - `revitcli://history/` (`application/json`) — recent snapshots from
    `HistoryStore` index.
  - `revitcli://profile/effective` (`text/yaml`) — resolved effective
    profile via `ProfileResolver`.
- New `snapshot` tool — read-only fresh capture for LLMs.
- New `set` tool — **double-gated** for safety:
  1. `mcp serve --allow-writes` flag must be set (server-side opt-in).
  2. Each call must include `confirm: true` in arguments (per-call opt-in).
  Without either, the tool returns a content-text refusal explaining how
  to enable. Defense in depth for LLM-driven model writes.

### Added — v2.0 dashboard (phase 1 — skeleton)

- New top-level dashboard project under `dashboard/` (SvelteKit +
  adapter-static + Tailwind + Chart.js). Phase 1 ships:
  - Project skeleton with pinned dependency versions (Node ≥ 20, npm
    ≥ 10). No `npm install` is run at check-in time — users run their
    own.
  - Overview page (current score, element-counts, 7-day sparkline
    placeholder div). Charts and Multi-project view land in a v2.0
    follow-up.
  - History loader via `?history=` query param or `/data/history.json`
    fallback.
- `revitcli dashboard serve [--port 8080] [--history-dir .revitcli/history]`
  — localhost-only static-file server backed by `HttpListener` (BCL,
  no new NuGet). Refuses to start if `dashboard/build/` is missing
  with a clear message.
- `revitcli dashboard build --output ./public [--history-dir <dir>]
  [--force]` — copies the prebuilt dashboard + injects the user's
  history index into `public/data/history.json`. Refuses to overwrite
  a non-empty output dir without `--force`.

### Added — v2.0 dashboard (phase 2 — Chart.js + History page)

Per `docs/roadmap-2026q2-q3.md` §7. Phase 1 shipped the skeleton +
data layer + Overview shell with placeholder DOM; phase 2 swaps in
real Chart.js charts and adds the dedicated History route.

- New shared chart components under `dashboard/src/lib/charts/`:
  - `CategoryBarChart.svelte` — horizontal bar chart for "elements
    per category" on Overview. Uses `indexAxis: 'y'` because category
    names ("Specialty Equipment", "Generic Models") need horizontal
    space the vertical layout truncates. Auto-sizes its height with
    row count so dense models still render every bar.
  - `ScoreSparkline.svelte` — score-over-time line chart. Default is
    minimal mode (no axes / grid) for the Overview's "last 7
    captures" widget; History page passes `minimal={false}` to surface
    the full y-axis 0–100.
  - `registerCharts.ts` — idempotent global Chart.js registration so
    SSR (svelte-kit's prerender) doesn't try to touch `window`.
- New `/history` route — full time-series chart over every captured
  snapshot + a delta table that compares each capture to the
  immediately previous one (Δscore, Δelements). Reads from the same
  `loadHistory()` source as Overview; no extra fetch. For a full
  element-by-element diff between two captures, the table footer
  points the operator at `revitcli history diff`.
- Layout enables the History nav link (was disabled in phase 1).
  Multi-project remains the only disabled link, marked for a v2.0
  follow-up.
- C# side unchanged: `dashboard serve` already handles SPA fallback
  for any extension-less path (`/history` → `index.html`), so no
  routing changes were needed.

### Added — v2.0 dashboard (Multi-project route — last §7 in-scope item)

Closes the v2.0 §7 range (In) checklist: the `/projects` route the
layout was previously advertising as disabled is now live, and the
CLI grew the supporting `dashboard build --project NAME:DIR` plumbing.

CLI — `revitcli dashboard build`
- New repeatable flag `--project NAME:DIR` (e.g. `--project
  "Office:./projA/.revitcli/history"`). Splits on the FIRST colon so
  Windows drive paths (`Office:C:\proj\hist`) survive intact. Names
  are case-insensitively unique within the run; duplicates fail fast.
- Orthogonal to `--history-dir`: pass both for the single-project
  Overview/History routes AND the multi-project comparison in one
  build. Pass neither for the v2.0 phase 1 default.
- New private writer `InjectProjectsAsync` builds
  `data/projects.json` of shape `{ version, projects: [{ name,
  historyDir, history }] }`. A missing or malformed per-project
  `index.json` becomes an inline placeholder so the build never
  blocks on one bad input — the dashboard renders a "0 captures"
  card instead.

Dashboard — `dashboard/`
- `src/lib/loadProjects.ts` — fetcher mirroring `loadHistory.ts`:
  `?projects=<url>` query param → `/data/projects.json` →
  `STUB_PROJECTS` fallback. Plus a `latestSummary(p)` helper that
  the route uses for card-level projection.
- `src/routes/projects/+page.svelte` — responsive grid (1 → 2 → 3
  columns) of project cards. Each card carries name, current score,
  element count, capture count, and a 7-capture sparkline reusing
  `ScoreSparkline`. Sorted by current score DESC, ties broken by
  name for determinism.
- Layout enables the `/projects` nav link (was disabled in phase 1
  + phase 2). All three v2.0 routes are now live.

### Added — v2.0 dashboard GitHub Pages deploy template

Per `docs/roadmap-2026q2-q3.md` §7 implementation step 9. Operators
who want to publish their dashboard get a SHA-pinned, ready-to-paste
workflow + a privacy-conscious operator guide.

- `docs/ci/dashboard-deploy-template.yml` — copy to
  `.github/workflows/dashboard-deploy.yml`. Builds the SvelteKit SPA,
  runs `revitcli dashboard build` to inject `history.json` (and
  optionally one or more `--project NAME:DIR` for the Multi-project
  route), uploads via `actions/upload-pages-artifact`, deploys via
  `actions/deploy-pages`. Concurrency-gated on the `pages` group so
  parallel pushes don't race the deploy lock. All third-party `uses`
  are SHA-pinned with version-label comments.
- `docs/ci/dashboard-github-pages.md` — the operator guide. Covers
  the privacy story up front (the dashboard's `app.html` already
  carries `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`, but a public
  deploy is still publicly fetchable; pointers to the Pages-from-
  private-repo flow), the `BASE_PATH` adjustments for project / user /
  custom-domain Pages, what `dashboard build` writes into `data/`,
  optional site-wide `static/robots.txt`, and the SHA-pin update
  workflow.
- `docs/ci/github-actions.md` cross-links the new doc.

### Added — v2.0 dashboard Playwright e2e (closes §7 step 10)

Per `docs/roadmap-2026q2-q3.md` §7 implementation step 10. Smoke
coverage for all three v2.0 routes; stub-data driven so the suite
runs from a fresh checkout with no operator history.

- `dashboard/playwright.config.ts` — single Chromium project,
  `webServer` launches `npm run dev` automatically. CI gets
  `forbidOnly`, fewer retries, GitHub reporter; local devs get the
  default `list` reporter and reused-server semantics.
- `dashboard/tests/e2e/`:
  - `overview.spec.ts` — header, demo-data badge, both Chart.js
    mounts (bar + sparkline), full nav surface
  - `history.spec.ts` — heading, time-series chart, delta table row
    count, Δscore column rendering
  - `projects.spec.ts` — card count, score-DESC sort order, per-card
    sparkline mount, score / elements / captures labels
  - `README.md` — run instructions + strategy notes
- `dashboard/package.json` — adds `@playwright/test` devDep + two
  scripts (`test:e2e`, `test:e2e:install`)
- `dashboard/.gitignore` — adds `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`,
  `playwright/.cache/`

Strategy: every assertion targets `data-test-id` hooks rather than
display copy, and pins SHAPE (counts, presence) rather than VALUES
(specific scores) so a future stub-data tweak or copy revision
doesn't break the suite.

### Added — MCP adapter (side track, unchanged)

- `revitcli mcp serve` — Model Context Protocol stdio server (spec
  `2024-11-05`). Exposes 3 read-only tools: `status`, `query`, `audit`.
  Use in `claude_desktop_config.json` as
  `"revitcli": { "command": "revitcli", "args": ["mcp", "serve"] }`. Write
  tools (`set` / `import` / `fix` / `rollback`) deferred pending a safety
  review of LLM-driven model writes.

### Added — post-audit follow-ups

- `revitcli export --dry-run` now actually parses: validates inputs and resolves
  sheet/view selectors but writes zero files; previously the README documented
  the flag while the parser rejected it.

### Fixed — post-audit follow-ups

- `revitcli doctor` now honors the `Revit<year>InstallDir` env var (Autodesk
  convention used by the addin csproj) when looking for `RevitAPI.dll`, so
  installs at non-default locations no longer trigger a false `FAIL`. The
  diagnostic message reports the path actually checked.

### Internal — repo hygiene and security hardening (no user-facing API changes)

- **Build**: centralized version (`Directory.Build.props` → `RevitCliVersion`) and
  central NuGet management (`Directory.Packages.props`). `TreatWarningsAsErrors`
  now enabled across all projects.
- **Add-in security**: API token now derives from `RandomNumberGenerator` (32 random
  bytes, hex) instead of `Guid.NewGuid()`. `~/.revitcli/server.json` is ACL-locked
  to the current Windows user (FullControl only, inheritance disabled) on write.
- **Add-in robustness**: `RemoveServerInfo` no longer leaks foreign server entries
  (`&&` → `||` ownership check). Port-bind retry, atomic write, and run-task
  observation now log narrowly-typed exceptions to stderr instead of swallowing
  them silently. `Thread.Sleep` retain-loop kept (already async-safe outside the
  Revit UI thread).
- **Add-in `/api/export`**: path traversal check now uses `Path.GetFullPath`
  canonicalization + `StartsWith(userProfile)` instead of a literal `..`
  substring search. Validated against 8 attack/legit cases.
- **Add-in `set`**: display→internal unit conversion failures now surface as
  `400` with a clear message instead of silently writing the raw value.
- **CLI HTTP**: default `HttpClient.Timeout` is 30s (override via
  `REVITCLI_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, clamped 1-3600). Previously implicit 100s.
- **CLI**: bare catches in `RevitClient.DiscoverServerUrl`, `CliConfig.Load`,
  and `JournalLogger.Log` narrowed and surfaced to stderr.
- **CLI**: shared `ServerInfo.DefaultPort` constant removes 3-way port
  hardcoding between addin, client, and config.
- **CI**: actions pinned to commit SHA. CLI `ci.yml` now matrices on
  ubuntu-latest × windows-latest. `ci-addin.yml` triggers on PR (paths
  filter) plus a daily 02:00 cron, no longer dispatch-only. `release.yml`
  drops `continue-on-error: true` from per-Revit-year add-in builds.
- **Tests**: `Fix_Apply_FailsWhenBaselineCannotBeSavedAndSkipsSet` reworked
  to use a cross-platform invalid baseline path (was Windows-only via `<>`).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- `revitcli fix` for dry-run and apply of profile-driven parameter fixes.
- `revitcli rollback` for journal-scoped restoration of fix changes.
- Structured `AuditIssue` metadata for fix planning.
- `setParam` and `renameByPattern` strategies.

### Out of scope

- Delete, geometry, family editing, and cross-document fixes.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-24

Model-as-Code Phase 3 — `revitcli import FILE.csv`. Closes the loop: snapshot
(P1) reads the model, publish --since (P2) re-exports only what changed, and
import (P3) writes parameter values back from CSV in batched transactions.

### Added — CSV import

- **`revitcli import FILE.csv`** — declarative bulk parameter writeback.
  Required: `--category` (e.g. `doors`, `墙`), `--match-by` (e.g. `Mark`).
  Optional: `--map "col:Param,col2:Param2"` (default identity), `--dry-run`,
  `--on-missing error|warn|skip` (default `warn`),
  `--on-duplicate error|first|all` (default `error`),
  `--encoding utf-8|gbk|auto` (default `auto`),
  `--batch-size N` (default 100, max 1000).
  Exit codes: 0 (success / dry-run / no rows), 1 (setup / parse / IO / fatal
  miss-or-dup), 2 (some groups failed at write time).
- **`Output/CsvParser`** — RFC 4180 parser with auto encoding detection:
  BOM (UTF-8 / UTF-16 LE / UTF-16 BE) → strict UTF-8 → GBK fallback. Required
  because Excel-exported Chinese CSV is GBK by default. Handles quoted values,
  escaped doubled-quotes, embedded commas/newlines, CRLF or LF.
- **`Output/CsvMapping`** — parses `--map` into a column→param dict;
  unspecified columns default to identity; `--match-by` column excluded from
  writes. Throws on malformed pairs or unknown columns.
- **`Output/ImportPlanner`** — pure-C# matching + grouping algorithm. Indexes
  Revit elements by trimmed `--match-by` value (case-sensitive ordinal),
  classifies CSV rows into Misses / Duplicates / Skipped per `--on-missing`
  and `--on-duplicate`, groups final writes by `(param, value)` so each
  unique pair becomes one batched `SetRequest`. Last-write-wins on repeated
  `(element, param)` with one warning per conflicting key.
- **`Commands/ImportCommand`** — orchestrator that wires CSV → mapping →
  query → planner → batched `SetParameter`. Single code path (TTY and pipe
  both produce plain text — `import` output is mostly counts).
- **`tests/RevitCli.Tests/TestInit.cs`** — `[ModuleInitializer]` registers
  `CodePagesEncodingProvider` once at test-assembly load so test code that
  builds GBK input via `Encoding.GetEncoding("gbk")` works without per-class
  fixture boilerplate.
- **Shell completions for import** — bash, zsh, and PowerShell tab-complete
  `--match-by`, `--map`, `--on-missing`, `--on-duplicate`, `--encoding`, plus
  static value lists for the latter three.

### Changed

- `src/RevitCli/Program.cs`: registers `CodePagesEncodingProvider` at startup
  so `Encoding.GetEncoding("gbk")` works on .NET 8 / Linux for production use.
- `src/RevitCli/RevitCli.csproj`: adds `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages 9.0.0`.
- `src/RevitCli/Commands/CliCommandCatalog.cs`: registers `import` in
  `TopLevelCommands`, `CreateRootCommand`, and `InteractiveHelpEntries`.

### Backward compatibility

- No changes to existing commands, profiles, DTOs, or addin endpoints.
- `import` reuses the existing `/api/elements` (query) and `/api/elements/set`
  (write) endpoints — **no addin upgrade required**. Users on v1.2.0 addin
  - v1.3.0 CLI gain `import` immediately.

### Test count

- 42 new facts across 4 new files + 3 completions assertions in the existing
  `CompletionsCommandTests`. CLI test suite total: **253** (was 211 after P2).
- New facts: `CsvParserTests` × 12, `CsvMappingTests` × 6,
  `ImportPlannerTests` × 12, `ImportCommandTests` × 12.

### End-to-end verification (manual — Windows + Revit 2026)

To verify on a live Revit:

1. Open a model with at least 3 doors; set `Mark` = `W01`, `W02`, `W03`.
2. Write `doors.csv` (UTF-8):
   ```
   Mark,锁具型号
   W01,YALE-500
   W02,YALE-700
   W03,YALE-500
   ```
3. `revitcli import doors.csv --category doors --match-by Mark --dry-run` →
   expect `groups=2, elementWrites=3` and per-group preview.
4. `revitcli import doors.csv --category doors --match-by Mark` →
   expect `Modified 3 element-parameter pair(s) across 2 group(s)`.
5. `revitcli query doors` → confirm `锁具型号` populated per CSV.
6. Re-save the same CSV from Excel as GBK and re-run; expect
   `encoding=gbk` line in plan summary and identical write outcome.

### Known Carry-forward

- Items already noted in v1.2.0 (Revit 2024 build compat for new `ElementId`
  ctor unverified, `--verbose` / `--severity` unimplemented, no progress
  signal during snapshot, README.md still v1.0.0 lineage).
- `import` writes only existing parameters: if the CSV references a Revit
  parameter that does not exist on the target element, the addin's `set`
  returns success with `Affected = 0` for that element. Treat 0 affected as
  a soft signal; surfacing this distinctly is a future enhancement.
- No interactive Spectre.Console table rendering for `import` results — TTY
  and pipe both emit plain text. Acceptable because `import` output is
  primarily counts.
- Duplicate CSV column names (e.g. two columns both named `Lock`) produce
  last-column-wins behavior with a warning. Users should rename their CSV
  headers if they hit this.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-23

Model-as-Code Phase 2 — incremental publish. Pairs `publish --since` with the
snapshot/diff infrastructure from v1.1.0 so a 50-sheet project can re-export
only the 3 sheets that changed, not the whole set.

### Added

- **`revitcli publish --since SNAPSHOT`** — diff a baseline snapshot against
  the current model and narrow each export preset's sheet selector to only the
  changed sheets. Options: `--since-mode content|meta` (default content),
  `--update-baseline` (rewrite the baseline on successful publish).
- **Profile `publish.<pipeline>.incremental: true`** — enable incremental
  publish by default. Baseline path defaults to `.revitcli/last-publish.json`
  and can be overridden with `publish.<pipeline>.baselinePath: <path>`.
  `sinceMode: content|meta` picks the diff granularity.
- **`SnapshotSheet.ContentHash`** — now populated (empty in v1.1.0). For each
  sheet, hashes its `MetaHash` + the element hashes of every non-type element
  in scope of each placed view. Skipped in `--summary-only` mode.
- **`SnapshotHasher.HashSheetContent`** — stable hash helper for sheet
  content, shared between CLI and addin.
- **`BaselineManager`** — atomic read/write of baseline snapshot files
  (tmp-then-rename via `File.Move(overwrite: true)`), used by publish to
  persist the post-publish state.
- **`SinceMode` enum** — content vs meta; used by `SnapshotDiffer.Diff`'s new
  optional `sinceMode` parameter.
- **Shell completions for publish** — `--since`, `--since-mode`, and
  `--update-baseline` now tab-complete in bash, zsh, and PowerShell.

### Changed

- **`SnapshotDiffer.Diff`** — new signature accepts `SinceMode sinceMode =
SinceMode.Meta`. Existing callers (v1.1.0 `revitcli diff` command) keep
  MetaHash-only behavior; new P2 call sites pass `SinceMode.Content`
  explicitly. A P1 baseline (empty ContentHash) falls back to MetaHash
  comparison automatically — no schema bump, no forced baseline rebuild.
- **Publish receipts / webhook payloads** now include `incremental` (bool)
  and `changedSheets` (int) fields when `--since` or `incremental: true` is
  active.

### Backward compatibility

- `schemaVersion` stays at `1`. A v1.1.0 baseline diffs cleanly against a
  v1.2.0 snapshot (content mode gracefully degrades to meta for sheets where
  either side has empty ContentHash).
- `revitcli diff` command output format unchanged.
- `revitcli snapshot` output is byte-identical for sheet MetaHash; only
  `contentHash` field transitions from `""` to real hashes.

### Known Carry-forward

- ContentHash does not honor Visibility/Graphics overrides — hiding a wall
  via V/G won't change `ContentHash`. This is intentional for performance;
  documented on `SnapshotSheet.ContentHash`.
- No progress signal during snapshot. Typical 100-sheet model should complete
  in <30s; if you hit this limit, open an issue.
- `--verbose` on `snapshot` and `--severity` on `diff` still unimplemented
  (carry-forward from v1.1.0).
- Revit 2024 (`-p:RevitYear=2024`, net48) build compat for the new
  `new ElementId(long)` call in `ComputeSheetContentHash` not verified —
  all existing call sites in the codebase use the same pattern and were
  presumed compiling in 2024 builds; needs a controller-driven test before
  a 2024 release. Revit 2026 verified end-to-end.

### End-to-end verification

Built on a real Revit 2026 model (9 walls, 9 doors, 2 windows, 16 schedules,
1 sheet added for this test). Snapshot writes non-empty contentHash. No-change
incremental publish prints "no sheets changed". After renaming the test
sheet, incremental publish correctly narrows the export to just that one
sheet.

Plan: [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-publish-since-incremental.md](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-publish-since-incremental.md)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-23

Model-as-Code Phase 1 — snapshot + diff infrastructure. This lays the
foundation for incremental publish (v1.2) and CSV import (v1.3).

### Added

- **`revitcli snapshot`** — capture the model's semantic state as JSON:
  elements grouped by category, sheets, schedules, and a counts summary.
  Options: `--output FILE`, `--categories LIST`, `--no-sheets`,
  `--no-schedules`, `--summary-only` (fast path, counts only).
- **`revitcli diff FROM TO`** — diff two snapshot JSONs. Formats:
  `table` (default), `json`, `markdown`. Options: `--report FILE`
  (format inferred from `.md`/`.json` extension), `--categories LIST`,
  `--max-rows N`. Errors on schema version mismatch; warns on
  DocumentPath mismatch.
- **Shared DTOs** (`shared/RevitCli.Shared/`):
  `ModelSnapshot`, `SnapshotRequest`, `SnapshotDiff` with every property
  carrying `[JsonPropertyName("camelCase")]` attributes for stable wire
  format.
- **`SnapshotHasher`** — pure static helper producing stable 16-char
  SHA256 hashes for elements, sheet metadata, and schedules. Sorts
  parameter keys Ordinally and escapes `\n`, `\`, `|` in values to
  prevent collisions.
- **`SnapshotDiffer`** — pure C# diff algorithm. Elements keyed by Id
  within each category, sheets by Number, schedules by Id. Defensively
  dedupes via `GroupBy().First()` so malformed input produces a clean
  diff instead of a raw `ArgumentException`.
- **`DiffRenderer`** — renders diffs as table / json / markdown with
  truncation at `--max-rows` and pipe-escape protection for Markdown
  table cells.
- **Addin endpoint** — `POST /api/snapshot` via `SnapshotController`
  wired into `RealRevitOperations.CaptureSnapshotAsync` (runs on the
  Revit main thread through `RevitBridge`). Full Revit API traversal:
  `FilteredElementCollector.OfCategory(...)` for elements,
  `OfClass(typeof(ViewSheet))` for sheets,
  `OfClass(typeof(ViewSchedule))` for schedules with body-cell hash.
- **48 new tests** across shared/CLI layers: DTO roundtrip, hash
  stability, diff algorithm edge cases, renderer formatting, CLI
  commands, and HTTP client wiring.

### Deferred to Phase 2 (v1.2)

- `SnapshotSheet.ContentHash` — view-level element aggregation for
  "sheet really changed?" detection. Currently left as empty string.
- `revitcli publish --since SNAPSHOT` — incremental re-export of only
  sheets whose content changed since the baseline.
- Profile `publish.incremental: true` flag + baseline auto-management.

### Known Carry-forward

- Addin test project (`tests/RevitCli.Addin.Tests/`) has pre-existing
  compile errors against Revit 2026 API (`UIApplication` reference
  missing in test csproj). Not caused by this release; flagged for a
  separate `chore: restore addin tests` commit.
- `--verbose` flag on the `snapshot` command is specified in the design
  doc but not yet implemented.
- `--severity added|removed|modified|all` flag on the `diff` command is
  specified in the design doc but not yet implemented. Workaround:
  filter by category with `--categories` or post-process the JSON
  output.
- `snapshot` / `diff` do not yet appear in the interactive REPL help
  listing (`CliCommandCatalog.InteractiveHelpEntries`) or in the
  shell-completion option-per-command blocks. Top-level command
  completion works.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-04

RevitCli v1.0 — production-ready local BIMOps runner for Revit teams.

### Added

- **`revitcli init`** — interactive profile creation from 3 starter templates
- **`revitcli score`** — model health score 0-100 with weighted rules and letter grade
- **`revitcli coverage`** — parameter fill rates by category with visual bar chart
- **Publish receipts** — `.revitcli/receipts/<pipeline>-<timestamp>.json` with profile hash, user, machine
- **15 commands total**: status, query, set, audit, export, check, publish, init, score, coverage, config, doctor, batch, completions, interactive

### Changed

- PDF export: no sheets + no views → actionable error instead of exporting all views
- Starter profiles embedded in CLI package (init works from installed tool)
- Publish receipt includes profileHash for auto-discovered profiles

### Production Readiness

- 122 tests (contract tests, integration tests, validation tests)
- 10 built-in audit rules + 2 profile-driven checks
- Documentation website with 5 pages
- 3 starter profiles (architectural, interior, general)
- Supports Revit 2024/2025/2026
- Install scripts, GitHub Actions release workflow
- Output contracts locked (JSON, HTML, exit codes, webhook payload)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Documentation website** (GitHub Pages, dark theme)
  - Quick Start guide, 3 core workflows, profile reference, troubleshooting
  - Live at https://xiaodream551-a11y.github.io/revitcli/

- **3 starter profiles** (`profiles/`)
  - `architectural-issue.yml` — room data, sheet completeness, pre-issue gate
  - `interior-room-data.yml` — room metadata, naming, FM handover
  - `general-publish.yml` — health checks, DWG/PDF/IFC pipelines

- **Doctor onboarding** — quickstart guidance when no profile detected
- **34 new tests** (86 → 122) — check command, journal, diff engine, output contracts, profile validation

### Changed

- Profile inheritance: `defaults.Notify` now properly inherited from parent
- Error messages are actionable (suggest fixes, list available options)
- `set --ids-from <file>` for Windows pipe workaround
- Malformed `--ids-from` input rejected with clear error (not silent partial)
- Publish suggests 'revitcli doctor' on connection failure

### Fixed

- Placeholder contract tests replaced with real assertions
- ParseIds tests exercise actual parser path

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Pipe composability**
  - `set --stdin`: read element IDs from stdin (JSON array or one per line)
  - `set --ids-from <file>`: read element IDs from JSON file (Windows-friendly)
  - `SetRequest.ElementIds`: batch element ID list for pipe workflows
  - Strict parsing with clear error messages on malformed input

- **Webhook notifications**
  - `defaults.notify` in `.revitcli.yml`: HTTPS URL to POST results
  - Fires after `check` and `publish` with status, counts, timestamp
  - HTTPS-only for security, non-blocking (errors to stderr)

- **Operation journal**
  - `.revitcli/journal.jsonl`: append-only log of `set` and `publish` operations
  - Records: action, parameters, affected count, user, timestamp
  - Both interactive and non-interactive paths log consistently

### Known Issues

- `--stdin` pipe does not work reliably with PowerShell + `dotnet run`; use `--ids-from` instead
- `--ids-from` has a serialization issue with the add-in API; use category+filter or --id for now

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **6 new audit rules** (total: 10 built-in + 2 profile-driven)
  - `views-not-on-sheets` — printable views/schedules not placed on sheets
  - `imported-dwg` — imported (not linked) CAD files
  - `in-place-families` — in-place families that should be loadable
  - `duplicate-room-numbers` — rooms sharing the same number
  - `room-metadata` — rooms missing number or using default name
  - `sheets-missing-info` — sheets with no number or empty content

- **Check result diff engine**
  - Auto-saves results to `.revitcli/results/` after each check run
  - Compares against previous run: reports new, resolved, unchanged issues
  - `--no-save` flag to skip storage (used by publish precheck)

### Changed

- **Naming rule rewritten**: replaced broad regex with prefix-based detection
  using known Revit default view prefixes (English + Chinese + German + French).
  System names like "标高 1" / "Level 1" are now whitelisted and no longer flagged.
- `views-not-on-sheets` and `sheets-missing-info` account for `ScheduleSheetInstance`
  placements (schedules on sheets are not false positives)
- `audit --list` output generated from rule registry (no more stale hardcoded strings)
- Diff output only appears in table format (JSON/HTML remain clean for CI parsers)
- Result storage wrapped in try/catch (I/O failures don't break audit output)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

  - `naming-pattern`: custom regex patterns for views, sheets, or any category

- **Multi-version Revit support**
  - Dual TFM: `net48` (Revit 2024) + `net8.0-windows` (Revit 2025/2026)
  - `RevitYear` build parameter with per-year output directories
  - Element IDs widened from `int` to `long` (64-bit ElementId since Revit 2024)

- **Capability/version model**
  - `status` reports `revitYear`, `addinVersion`, and `capabilities` list
  - CLI displays add-in version and capabilities

- **Installer**
  - `install.ps1`: auto-detects Revit years, per-year add-in deployment, PATH setup
  - `uninstall.ps1`: multi-year manifest removal, optional `-Purge`
